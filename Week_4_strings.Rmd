```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

Typing within single or double quotes will create a string 

```{r echo=TRUE}
"character"
```

You can also have a vector of strings

```{r echo=TRUE}
c("this","is","a","character","vector")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
