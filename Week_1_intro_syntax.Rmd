knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Comments

You can add comments to your code using the `#` symbol.  It can go at the
beginning of a line, or in the middle of a line after whatever code is
on that line.

```{r}
# a full line comment
1 + 1

2 + 2 # comment immediately after code
```

## The assignment operator

Any time you create a variable, or change the value of a variable, in R,
you use the arrow operator `<-` to do it.  If a line of code doesn't have
this symbol, nothing in your environment changes.

```{r}
x <- 2 + 3
```
