R Markdown
----------

Typing within single or double quotes will create a string

``` r
"character"
```

    ## [1] "character"

You can also have a vector of strings

``` r
c("this","is","a","character","vector")
```

    ## [1] "this"      "is"        "a"         "character" "vector"

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
