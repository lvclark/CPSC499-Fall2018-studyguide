## How to edit

The index, `when_did_we_learn.md` can be edited directly.

For each week, edit the .Rmd file, not the .md file.  Before making your commit,
run `source("render.R")` to render all .Rmd files to .md files.  If you know
what you are doing, you can just run `render` on the one file that you edited.

Before you start editing, remember to Pull so that you have the most up-to-date
version.

Feel free to add more files!
