## Comments

You can add comments to your code using the `#` symbol. It can go at the
beginning of a line, or in the middle of a line after whatever code is
on that line.

``` r
# a full line comment
1 + 1
```

    ## [1] 2

``` r
2 + 2 # comment immediately after code
```

    ## [1] 4

## The assignment operator

Any time you create a variable, or change the value of a variable, in R,
you use the arrow operator `<-` to do it. If a line of code doesn’t have
this symbol, nothing in your environment changes.

``` r
x <- 2 + 3
```
