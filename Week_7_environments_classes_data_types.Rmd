## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Converting from factor to numeric

If you are ever in the situation where you need to convert factors to numeric you must first convert to character and then to numeric. If you try to go directly from factor to numeric it'll just convert you values to the level (like level 1,2,3, etc.) that is associated with it.

```{}
# a <- as.character(x)
# b <- as.numeric(a)

# you can also do this in one line
# a <- as.numeric(as.character(x))

```
