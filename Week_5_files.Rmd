knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## File Properties 

Files are a linear arangement of data points. The data they store are either 0's or 1's. Files are a linear set of bytes, with 1 bit being equal to 8 bits. The bit is what is eqal to either 0 or 1.  

When you or a program access a file, a connection is opened.When you are done with the file, the connection is closed. 

Code for using a file.

file - opens a connection, either a writing or reading connection
readLines - preview a file a few lines at a time
writeLines - writes just hte sequences to the new file.
close - closes the connection

Files can be compressed to save processing time. Different formats incluse ZIP or GZIP.

opening and closing connections can be useful if you file is very large and you dont want to use a lot of memory all at once.

## Writing vs Appending 

When you open a connection in mode write, any changes you make will overwrite the origional file.

when you are in mode append, any changes will be added to the end of the file


## read.table 

Using read.table will create an object of class data frame. A data frame is a list of vectors that are the same length.

There are different ways to subset a data frame.
mydata$column-name
mydata[[1]]
mydata[1:5, 1:5]

if your data frame has column headers, you need to specify that when you read the table in.
use header folowed by sep and then "" with whatever character seperates the data between the quotes.

You can also recognize missing values using na.strings

## write.table 

Exports a data frams to a file

to export as an excel file use write.csv

use col.names or row.names if you want the header or row names included in the file you are creating. 

## Saving objects in your R environment

Instead of exporting a file you can save it in your r environment as an .RData file.

use save.image, or save for large datasets.

downside: has to beopened in R

load is used to import these files into R.
